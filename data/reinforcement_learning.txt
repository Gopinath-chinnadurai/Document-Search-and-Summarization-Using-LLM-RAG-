Reinforcement Learning is a branch of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Unlike supervised learning, reinforcement learning does not rely on labeled datasets. Instead, the agent learns through trial and error by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions.

A reinforcement learning system consists of an agent, an environment, actions, states, and rewards. The agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses an action. After performing the action, the environment transitions to a new state and provides a reward. The goal of the agent is to learn a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time.

One of the most common reinforcement learning algorithms is Q-learning. Q-learning uses a value function called the Q-function to estimate the expected reward of taking a specific action in a given state. Over time, the agent updates its Q-values to improve decision-making. More advanced methods include policy gradient methods and actor-critic algorithms.

Reinforcement learning is widely used in applications where sequential decision-making is required. Examples include game playing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, and recommendation strategies. Famous successes include AI agents that can play chess, Go, and video games at superhuman levels.

Deep Reinforcement Learning combines reinforcement learning with deep neural networks. In this approach, neural networks approximate value functions or policies, enabling learning in complex and high-dimensional environments. However, reinforcement learning systems can be unstable and require careful tuning.

Challenges in reinforcement learning include exploration versus exploitation, sample efficiency, and reward design. Despite these challenges, reinforcement learning remains a powerful approach for solving dynamic decision-making problems.
